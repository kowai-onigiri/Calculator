# Calculator

This calculator is a project from The Odin Project curriculum. In total, this project took me about 12 hours to complete and required a few different attempts before
I arrived at a product I was satisfied with. As per the best learning method, my first attempt involved me setting up the HTML and CSS on my own and crafting the 
beginnings of the JavaScript component. 

After a few hours of working with different formulas and drafting several pseudocode scripts, I followed some tutorials online for setting up the meat of my script. 
To get the result I wanted, I had to practice through a few different tutorials, learning the relationships between constants, event listeners, functions, and even 
objects for tutorials' take on a calculator script. With each iteration, I edited my HTML elements and made any adjustments to class/id andto the CSS to ensure that 
my calculator could interpret script adjustments properly. 

Finally, I pieced together a script that handled my desired actions and allowed me to include a previous output display.

I'd like to expand on this project by adding a delete button, incorporating key input, adding more functionality such as longer inline equations and more operators, 
and perhaps adding a 'dark mode.'
